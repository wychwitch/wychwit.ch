    I'm wych! This is my site! Yahoo!

## How?? How did you make this
I made this site using [Lume](https://lume.land/), a static site generator framework built on deno. I'm serving it using github pages! I spent way too much time on this.

I'm not sure what else to say uhhhh check out my [github](https://github.com/wychwitch) maybe?
## Is there anything on here?

Not really. I plan on adding an articles section and hosting fics, but, man

## Speaking of plans, why don't you post your to-do list for this site?
Good idea! Thanks me!

-  Reduce code repeating by making the templates share more code (please) 
-  Create articles section
-  Write first silly little fic
-  Make links page, and embed it here as well
-  Include latest bsky posts?? Maybe????
-  Put wychbug on here, somewhere
-  Make art! Again! And post it here maybe? Or host using the booru I miss
